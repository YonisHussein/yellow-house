# The motivation for this task was to generate a password for anyone who uses it

# this project was made for the sole purpose of making it easier for the user to get what he wants in his password

# it solves the problem of having to find a secure password for the user

# i learned alot about javascript and it made me realize a lot of things i wouldn't otherwise think when I'm writing code

# It works the way it should
